<h2>Mind your Carbohydrates</h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to talk about carbohydrates. I like to think that our bodies as systems are still pretty
much set up like we have been since homo sapiens were nomadic hunter-gatherers. If you think of your system like this you would have 
ate food quickly and in large amounts as it was abundant. Things that contained sugar would have been eaten when they could be found and
your body would have used this as a quick fuel source. <span #tstyle><a href="protein.html">Protein</a></span> 
and <span #tstyle><a href="fats.html">Fat</a></span> 
would be able to be used also, excess nutrients would have been
stored as <span #tstyle><a href="fats.html">Fat</a></span> for times when food was scarce.
 Technology and society have developed much quicker than are bodies are evolving. Processed foods
are packed with bad <span #tstyle><a href="fats.html">Fats</a></span> like trans
<span #tstyle><a href="fats.html"> Fats</a></span> and processed sugar. 
Our bodies were not meant to consume these substances in large quantities, in large
quantities they are toxic and lead to diseases like diabeties, obesity and cancer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you do ketogenic diet you are a carbohydrate hater right? Wrong!, there are healthy carbohydrates and doing
 the ketogenic diet doesn't mean you can never have sugar you just now how to budget your diet to work for you. All vegetables 
 have carbohydrates as well so how do you make that work? You have to use a method of calculating carbohydrates called net carbs. You would select a healthy
 vegetable look at the carbs and look at the fiber it contains as well. You subtract the fiber from the carbohydrates and that gives you your net carbs.
