<h2>Your Primary Fuel Source</h2>
<img  id="fatspic" src="images/fatspic.gif" alt="Picture of Coconut Oil" title="Coconut Oil">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By limiting your 
<span #tstyle><a href="carbohydrates.html">Carbohydrates</a></span> to under 20 grams a day, increasing 
your healthy fat intake to 70% of your coloric intake for the day and keeping
your <span #tstyle><a href="protein.html">Protein</a></span> down to 8oz a day you 
will be able to put your body into a state of nutritional ketosis. When your body is in nutritional ketosis you will utilzie dietary fats as fuel 
instead of glycogen which comes from sugars. Fats are broken down into keytone bodies and ketones are the fuel your body will use.
Ketones are a clean fuel source that brings mental clarity and boosted energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macros are a calorie map of how much of each nutrient you should be ingesting. Your macros should be
 70% fats, 25% <span #tstyle><a href="protein.html">Proteins</a></span>, 
 and 5% <span #tstyle><a href="carbohydrates.html">Carbohydrates</a></span>. 
 When most people think of fat they think of the excess weight they carry or heart disease,
 calories from fat are your main nutritional ingredient on the ketogenic diet. Healthy dietary fats are fats such as Omega 3, Omega 6 fatty acids,
short chain tryglicerides, medium chain tryglicerides, and long chain tryglicerides. Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids are very good for your brain and heart. 
As a general rule if it is good for your heart your brain will also benifit as your brain utilizes 30% of your blowflow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do you do this? Figuring out what to eat was the most difficult part of the journey for me but I will help you
  on my recipe page. Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids can be abundantly found in a great deal of delicious foods such as salmon, chicken, red meat ( especially hamburger )
  chia seeds, and some nuts like almonds and macadamia nuts.The superfood of the ketogenic diet is the avacado. If you like avacadoes you are in heaven as they may be the perfect food on this diet.
  The avocado is superfood rich in dietary fats, vitamins, and potassium.</p>
